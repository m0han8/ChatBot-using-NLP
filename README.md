# ChatBot-using-NLP


This project implements an intelligent chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The chatbot is trained to recognize various user inputs and respond contextually using a predefined dataset of intents and responses. It leverages NLTK for text processing and scikit-learn for classification.
